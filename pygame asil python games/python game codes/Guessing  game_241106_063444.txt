Here's a basic game programming tutorial using Python and VS Code:

*Game:* "Guess the Number"

*Objective:* The user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

*Step 1:* Install VS Code and Python extension

*Step 2:* Create a new Python file (`(link unavailable)`) in VS Code

*Step 3:* Write the game code:
```
import random

def game():
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    guess = None
    while guess != number_to_guess:
        guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
        if guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number_to_guess:
            print("Too high!")
    print("Congratulations! You won!")

game()
```
*Step 4:* Run the game by clicking the "Run" button or pressing `F5`

*Step 5:* Play the game by guessing numbers until you win!

This game demonstrates basic concepts like variables, loops, conditional statements, and user input. You can build upon this foundation to create more complex games.

Some tips:

- Use the `random` module to generate random numbers.
- Use `input()` to get user input.
- Use `int()` to convert user input to an integer.
- Use `while` loops to create a game loop.
- Use `if` statements to handle different game scenarios.

Have fun coding and gaming!
